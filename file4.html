				The Story:
				Channel Islands National Park is home to a wide variety of significant 
				natural and cultural resources. It was designated a U.S. National Monument 
				on April 26, 1938, and a National Biosphere Reserve in 1976. It was promoted 
				to a National Park on March 5, 1980. Channel Islands National Marine
				Sanctuary encompasses the waters six nautical miles around Channel Islands
				National Park.
				Channel Islands National Park comprises 5 ecologically rich islands off the 
				Southern California coast. Anacapa Island has trails to a 1932 lighthouse 
				and clifftop Inspiration Point. Santa Cruz Island’s many sea caves include
				the vast Painted Cave. Santa Rosa Island features rare Torrey pines. 
				Thousands of seals gather at San Miguel Island’s Point Bennett. 
				Southernmost Santa Barbara Island draws nesting seabirds.
			</p>
			<p>	The Culture:
				The oldest human remains in North America, dating to 13,000 B.C., were 
				discovered in 1959 on Santa Rosa Island.
				The Channel Islands were created by tectonic forces, which caused them to 
				rise up out of the ocean five million years ago. They have always been 
				islands separate from the mainland, and thus have unique plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.				
			</p>
			<p>
				How to Visit
				Five islands off the Southern California coast comprise one 
				of America’s most remote—and utterly magical—national parks.
				Visitors arrive on the islands by boat (boats depart regularly 
				from Ventura and Oxnard) or small plane, then use their hiking boots 
				or kayaks to get around. Revered for its endemic plants and plentiful
				wildlife, the “Galapagos of North America” has no lodgings, stores, or 
				restaurants—a place that draws you in without a lot of extra trappings. 
				On this ocean sanctuary, it’s all about wraparound beauty, solitude, 
				and the chance to totally and completely unplug.
